                <p><span>O</span>n Monday (August 15), the East African nation of Malawi will launch the first of four rounds of a large-scale polio vaccination campaign in an effort to stop the devastating virus from spreading further, according to STAT. 
                    In February, a 4-year-old girl who lives outside of the country’s capital, Lilongwe, was diagnosed with type 1 polio and became paralyzed as a result of her infection. The case was the country’s first in three decades and the first on the continent since 2020. According to STAT, the poliovirus likely made its way into Malawi from Pakistan, one of only two countries where polio is still endemic. Officials determined that the child did not catch polio during travel to Pakistan, meaning that the poliovirus was likely circulating in Malawi. 
                    Polio is a devastating virus. It spreads quickly and easily between children through fecal matter but causes few or no symptoms in many. But one out of every 200 who are infected become permanently paralyzed, and some die. There is no cure. 
                    Zambia, Mozambique, and Tanzania will join the first round of Malawi’s mass vaccination campaign next week, and jointly plan to vaccinate 9.4 million children over four days. Zimbabwe is scheduled to join later rounds, expected to begin in May and June, Modjirom Ndoutabe, the polio coordinator in the World Health Organization’s Regional Office for Africa, tells STAT. By the end of the campaign, organizers hope to administer 80 million doses of the bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine and immunize 23 million children under the age of 5, according to a WHO press release. The goal of the campaign is to reach children that are only partially immunized or who have never been immunized. The WHO recommends that children get four doses of the vaccine over the first six years of their lives.
